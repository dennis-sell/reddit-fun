## Web Stack

*Mobile*: Swift is thought to be really fun, and a huge improvement on the Objective-C days of iOS dev. Alternatively I could choose React Native for an implementation that will work across systems.

*Backend*: Python is great becaue of its rich web frameworks. It is widely thought of as a great language for web development, and we won't outgrow the downside of python for a very long time, at which point we can consider other languages for microservices.

My choices are Django vs Flask for python. Django is a more opinionated framework that does more for you from the start. However, it can be harder to write some things in Django if your use-case doesn't fit the Django paradigm. Meanwhile Flask is quite customizable and unopinionated, but takes a lot more work to setup. I think I'll go with Django so I can get a sense of it's support and limitations. I've tried Flask before, so I won't learn as much if I try it again.

Alternatively, I could use ruby on rails if I want to force myself to learn a new web framework language. I think I'll skip that so I can save my New-Language-Learning-Energy for the mobile development.
